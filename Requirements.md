# README

## Overview

This project is a quick test to build a small frontend using **Next.js**. The
task involves fetching and displaying data from the Footium GraphQL API while
providing basic interactivity and filtering.

- **Time limit**: Please aim to spend no more than 2 hours.
- **GraphQL endpoint**: `https://live.api.footium.club/api/graphql`
- There is no right or wrong answer, it is designed to allow you to showcase
  your skill set, intuition and decision making.

## Requirements

- Use **Next.js**.
- Use TypeScript.
- Ensure the UI is intuitive and user-friendly.
- Implement breakpoints for mobile and desktop to change how the content is
    displayed based on the viewport responsively.
- Keep the project structure clean and modular.

1. **Input Club ID** - Allow the user to enter a club ID, which will be used to
fetch the players.

2. **Fetch Players** - Query the API to fetch all players for the provided club
ID.

3. **Toggles for Filtering** - Add a toggle to show/hide retired players
   (`isRetired: boolean`). Add a toggle to show/hide academy players
   (`isAcademy: boolean`).

4. **Sorting** - Allow the user to sort by two fields of your choosing.

## Submission

Submit a zip of your final git repository.

## Notes

- Focus on functionality rather than polish. This test is not about perfect
  design.
- If any part of the task is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and document
  them.
- Feel free to add improvements or features to highlight your skills, but keep
  it within the time limit.
- Feel free to ask any questions if needed and provide feedback.
